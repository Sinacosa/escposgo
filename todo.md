### Description 
This is a sample project to play with go. The goal is tp build a library so we can print stuff on a termal printer. 
We're going to implement the esc/pos protocol 

Here is what we need to do 
+ Detect the connected device 
+ Connect to the device
+ Create some esc/pos commands
+ Send commands to the printer 
+ Write tests

Basically I want the library to do the following: 

Done - connect to device 
Done - print text 
- format tables 
- change the font 
Done - feed the printer
